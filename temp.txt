Design Ideas

FOR ILLUSTRATION
- Have it similar to the video, but have a pencil / pen finishing off some cursive writing of the headline
    - Balance it out with something on the other side then? A notebook with a drawing? 
- Keep it simple and clean
- Have an illustration of "me" (Animated version!)
- Simple illustrations of things I like -> keep it in a theme though

FOR ABOUT ME
- Hover effect on my picture that changes the picture to me waving
- I SHOULD DO A PHOTOSHOOT FOR MYSELF NOW THAT I KNOW HOW TO USE PHOTOSHOP

TODO: 
- Make the skill list stay in center of screen when resizing screen 


FOR FOOTER
- Have something similar to the header but with less going on
